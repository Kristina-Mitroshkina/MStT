Mavenized version of the JADE Book Trading example
==================================================

Usage
-----

To try JADE with this example, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and run the main agent container with

       ./start-main-container.sh

   The GUI for the JADE remote monitor agent should pop up.Leave the terminal open.

2. Open another terminal and run one or more seller agents with

       ./start-seller.sh host agentname

   where 'host' is the hostname of the machine running the main agent
   container and 'agentname' is the name of the agent.
   'localhost' and 's1' will work fine from the
   same machine running the main container.

   This command will display a dialog asking for the name and price
   of all the books that can be sold by that agent. Keep entering as
   many names and prices as you want.

3. Once all the books have been entered, open another terminal
   and run the buyer agent with

       ./start-buyer.sh host agentname bookname

   where 'host' and 'agentname' play the same roles as before, and
   'bookname' is the name of the book that the agent should get for
   as cheap as possible.
